## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how a 3D environment can be used to replicate a **real park experience**.  
Users can move around the park, interact with objects (hotspots), and enjoy the realistic atmosphere created through lighting and sounds.

**Key Features**
- 🏞️ Interactive 3D park environment
- 🚶‍♂️ First-person / free camera navigation
- 💡 Baked and real-time lighting setup
- 🔊 Ambient nature sounds and click interactions
- 🪑 Prefabs for benches, lamps, trees, and fountain
- 🎮 User-friendly UI for teleportation and help info
- 🌐 WebGL and Desktop builds supported
- 🧩 Modular C# scripts for clean game logic
